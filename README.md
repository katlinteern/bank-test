### Overview

This app provides a concise overview of an investment portfolio, summarizing all investments and offering detailed insights for each. Users can easily monitor total values, prices, and quantities, focusing on profitability and overall investment performance. Profitability is calculated using the XIRR method, which accurately accounts for irregular cash flows, transaction fees, and dividends.
